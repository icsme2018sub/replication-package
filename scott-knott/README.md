# ScottKnott Analsyis

We report here the results about the Scott-Knott test.

With this test, we divide the features into distinct groups having a stastically significant difference in the mean (p-value < 0.05).

* [Dynamic Model](https://github.com/icsme2018sub/replication-package/blob/master/scott-knott/scott_dynamic%2Bstatic.csv)

We rely on an implementation of the Scott-Knott test publicy available on GitHub at [this link](https://github.com/klainfo/ScottKnottESD)
